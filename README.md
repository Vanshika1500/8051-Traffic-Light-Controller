# 8051-Traffic-Light-Controller
Implemented a smart traffic light controller using the 8051 microcontroller, featuring timed RED–YELLOW–GREEN sequencing and automatic day/night mode switching using an LDR sensor. Programmed in Embedded C (Keil µVision5) and fully simulated in Proteus 8.10 to validate LED logic and sensor-based transitions
